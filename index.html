            <h2>
                Why Am I Here?
            </h2>
            
            <p style="color:goldenrod"> The very basic answer to that question is the 
                fact that I am a digital studies minor and computer science major and this 
                class fits into both of those really well. But the more complicated answer
                is the fact that I think website design is incredibly cool and something that I
                have dabbled with on my own but would love to learn more about. </p>
            
            <h2>
                What I have done up until now?
            </h2>
            
            <p style="color:tomato"> As a CSC major, I have a decent amount of experience
                coding from classes that I have taken and side projects of my own. I have learned 
                java, python, and c# here at Davidson. My experience with web dev is strictly 
                personal interest to this point. I have made my own site to act as an online resume
                of sorts for myself through watching youtube videos and looking up quick fixes
                to problems that arose. I am eager to learn more.

            <h2>
                What do I want to accomplish here?
            </h2>
            
            <p style="color:tomato"> 
                More than anything I would love to have a final website that I can point to as proof
                of knowing what web dev is all about. Secondly, I just want to become very familiar and 
                comfortable in these languages so that they are almost second nature for me. I hope to use them
                often in the future and so I would love to get a good start on that now.

            <h2>
                Learning Computing
            </h2>
            
            <pre style="color:goldenrod">
I selected the command line section as a way to learn more about computing.
 The command line as a whole can be slighlty intimidating but it has a lot of 
 potential that people don't realize. Here's what I learned...

 • The command line is a text interface that 
 communicates directly with your computer's Operating System (OS)

 • You can use it to display your computer id, print 
 out statements, an other basic actions.

 • A basic but useful action is navigating the directory 
of your computer through commands like "ls" which 
gives lists of all direcotry files. 

• If you'd ever like to change your directory or where 
you are in your computer you can use "cd /" or "cd~/" 
in order to return home

• Finally a useful and time saving use for the command line 
is the creating, writing and running of files***. 

    *** You can create a document, add content to it (for 
    instance a snippet of code written in python) and the 
    command line will write (create and execute the file)
    and return the result of whatever script is created.***

The Command Line can be used to manipulate files on your computer's OS in a 
more effecient and faster way. Knowing your computer better will allow you to 
be better organized and execute smaller and sometimes large commands much faster 
and easier.

                <strong style="color:tomato">Favorite Music Page: </strong>
                I think it would be really interesting to create a page that has the album covers of 
                someone's favorite musical artists or albums. The idea would be whenever you scroll 
                over or click on the album you would be able to read about the history of the album
                and artist.

                This summer, I was constantly looking for different places in which to play soccer, but 
                what I was running into was the fact that it was actually quite difficult to find fields on 
                places like google or apple maps. I would love to create a website or webapp (I know this
                requires more work than just html etc.) that finds all the fields or parks in an area 
                and displays them for the public.

                One of the most frustrating moments in life is when I hear a song or someone says a quote 
                and I know it's from a movie but I can't quite place where it's from. I would love to see a 
                webapp that allows the user to search for a quote or a song and it will show where and when
                in the corresponding movie it is. It would give the full quote and movie.
